### Solutions to Selected Exercises and Programming Projects from K. N. King's excellent book

I learned C when I was an undergrad at the University of Texas.  We used the
first edition of K. N. King's book.  Now I am half-way through my PhD and I am
using some C again to speed up some simulations.  I bought the second edition of
King's book, and reading it has made me fall in love with C again.

K. N. King's book is excellent and up to date.  Don't just take my word for it,
take a look at the [reviews on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Modern-Approach-2nd-Edition/dp/0393979504).

I think the best way to learn a language is to program in it, thus I am working
through some of the exercises and programming projects at the end of the
chapter.  Note that my solutions occasionally use more advanced parts of the
language than you would know if you were working through the book while learning
C from the book the first time.  I don't work through all the exercises or
projects, and I don't guarantee my solutions are correct.

I put the code on Github so that other students teaching themselves C can
benefit from seeing someone else's solutions.

To anyone who is copying this for a class: you are shooting yourself in the foot
by not learning the material for yourself, while simultaneously being
unethical!  Shame on you.
