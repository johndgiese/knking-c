### Solutions to Selected Exercises and Programming Projects from K. N. King's excellent book

I learned C when I was an undergrad at the University of Texas.  We used the
first edition of K. N. King's book.  Now I am half-way through my PhD and I am
using some C again.  I bought the second edition of his book, and reading it
has made me fall in love with C again.

K. N. King's book is excellent and up to date.  Don't just take my word for it,
take a look at the [reviews on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Modern-Approach-2nd-Edition/dp/0393979504).

I think the best way to learn a language is to program in it, thus I am working
through some of the exercises and programming projects at the end of the
chapter.  Note that I occasionally use more advanced parts of the language than
you would know if you were learning C from the book the first time.  Also note
that I certainly don't gauruntee these solutions are correct.

I put the code on Github so that other people teaching themselves C can possibly
benefit from seeing someone else's solutions.

To anyone who is copying this for a class: you are shooting yourself in the foot
by not learning the material for yourself, while simulataneously being
unethical!  Shame on you.
